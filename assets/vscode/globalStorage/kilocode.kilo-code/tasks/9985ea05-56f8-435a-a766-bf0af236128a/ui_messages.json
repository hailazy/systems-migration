overview\n- The product vision captured in [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md) clearly stakes out the horror tone, symbiosis fantasy, and dual-form movement pillars.\n- The systems guidance in [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md) embraces composition, a shared [`SignalBus`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md:21), resources-as-data, and strict typing, giving a scalable baseline for complex possession logic.\n- The technology context in [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md) fixes Godot 4.5.1 Forward+ and enumerates the core node stack, aligning tools with the intended gameplay.\n\nPotential issues and gaps\n- Core loop, progression cadence, and host taxonomy are unspecified, making it hard to translate the symbiosis fantasy into repeatable gameplay beats.\n- No concrete blueprint exists for parasite↔host state transitions, stat/ability transfer rules, or host degradation/cooldowns, risking late-stage rework of the flagship mechanic.\n- Movement and animation plans stop at mentioning hybrid motion; there is no documented strategy for AnimationTree graphs, blend spaces, or transition rules between parasite and humanoid forms.\n- Resource-driven design is promised but lacks schemas for host archetypes, ability loadouts, or movement profiles, hampering balancing and tooling.\n- Input responsiveness (buffering, coyote time, remapping) is absent from standards, which can undermine action feel.\n- Collision layers currently end at interactables, leaving no budget for hitboxes, hazards, possession triggers, or projectiles.\n- Pixel-art rendering notes omit stretch mode/aspect, pixel snap, mipmap policy, and import presets, inviting visual inconsistencies across scenes.\n- Testing, debugging, and save/load strategies are unaddressed, creating risk once state machines and resource swaps proliferate.\n\nRecommended improvements\n- Author a core gameplay loop document defining possession objectives, host acquisition, progression gates, failure states, and run structure.\n- Design a symbiosis state chart (parasite scout, possession attempt, host control, forced ejection) driven by [`SignalBus`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md:21) events and component contracts such as `PossessionComponent`, `AbilityLoadoutComponent`, and `HostHealthComponent`.\n- Establish resource schemas (e.g., `HostArchetypeResource`, `AbilityResource`, `MovementProfileResource`) to keep stats, abilities, and animation cues editable outside code.\n- Plan the animation pipeline: AnimationTree state machines per form, naming conventions, blend space usage, and host/parasite transition clips.\n- Implement an input buffer wrapper for [`move_and_slide()`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md:39) controllers to support coyote time, jump buffering, and press/hold differentiation.\n- Expand collision layer conventions to dedicate slots for player hurtboxes, enemy hurtboxes, projectiles, hazards, possession volumes, pickups, and scripted triggers.\n- Document pixel-art project settings (stretch mode/aspect, pixel snap, nearest filtering, mipmap policy) and sprite import presets to enforce consistent presentation.\n- Introduce testing and debug infrastructure (GdUnit4/WAT smoke tests around possession transitions, an in-game debug HUD surfacing active host, abilities, and buffered inputs, plus early save/load scaffolding).\n- Formalize asset workflow expectations (palette references, layered source control, export automation) and CI hooks to keep `.tres` resources and scripts in sync as the team scales.\n\nDeliverables\n- Added the written assessment in [docs/memory_bank_review.md](docs/memory_bank_review.md) for ongoing reference.\n- Changes committed under `docs(memory-bank): add analysis review`. No automated tests were available to run for verification."},{"ts":1764346639391,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""}]
