Here's what I discovered:\n\n### 1. Auto-Commit Rule Documentation\nThe [`.kilocode/rules/auto-commit.md`](.kilocode/rules/auto-commit.md:1) file is clear and properly documented with:\n- Correct commit format convention: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`\n- Comprehensive list of commit types\n- Clear 4-step procedure for commits\n\n### 2. Git Hooks Configuration\n- **Git hooks path is correctly configured**: `core.hookspath=.githooks`\n- **Hook files have proper permissions**: Both [`pre-commit`](.githooks/pre-commit:1) and [`commit-msg`](.githooks/commit-msg:1) are executable (`-rwxr-xr-x`)\n\n### 3. Hook Functionality Verification\nI tested both hooks and confirmed they work as expected:\n\n**Pre-commit hook** ([`.githooks/pre-commit`](.githooks/pre-commit:1)):\n- Successfully checks for trailing whitespace\n- Skips shellcheck gracefully when not installed (expected behavior)\n- Runs without errors\n\n**Commit-msg hook** ([`.githooks/commit-msg`](.githooks/commit-msg:1)):\n- **Properly enforces Conventional Commits format**\n- Rejects invalid commit messages with clear error guidance\n- Accepts properly formatted messages\n\n### 4. Test Results\n- ✅ Valid commit (`test: verify hooks are working`) → **Accepted**\n- ❌ Invalid commit (`invalid commit message`) → **Rejected with helpful error message**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe auto-commit rule is **not failing or not triggering** - it's working correctly. The hooks are properly installed, configured, and enforcing the commit message format as specified in the auto-commit rule. If commits are failing, it's likely because:\n1. The commit message doesn't follow the required format\n2. There are trailing whitespace issues in the staged files\n3.

The \"failure\" you are experiencing is likely due to the strict enforcement of the Conventional Commits format by the `commit-msg` hook, or a misunderstanding of how the rule operates (it instructs the AI to execute the command, rather than triggering a background system process).\n\nHere are the exact configuration settings and code snippets required to ensure the feature works as intended.\n\n### 1. The Auto-Commit Rule\nThis file instructs Kilo Code on *how* and *when* to commit. It must be placed at `.kilocode/rules/auto-commit.md`.\n\n```markdown\n# Auto-Commit Rule\n\nWhen a task is completed successfully, you MUST automatically commit the changes using the following convention:\n\nFormat: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`\n\nTypes:\n- feat: A new feature\n- fix: A bug fix\n- docs: Documentation only changes\n- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)\n- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- perf: A code change that improves performance\n- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries\n\nExample: `feat(auth): add login validation`\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Verify all tests pass (if applicable).\n2. Stage all changed files: `git add .`\n3. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m \"type(scope): description\"`\n4. If the commit fails due to hooks, fix the issues and retry.\n```\n\n### 2. Git Configuration\nYou must tell Git to use your custom hooks directory. Run this command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\n```\n\n### 3. Hook Permissions\nThe hook files must be executable. Run this command:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x .githooks/pre-commit .githooks/commit-msg\n```\n\n### 4. Verification Guide\nFollow these steps to verify the rule is active and the hooks are enforcing standards:\n\n1.  **Check Git Config**:\n    Run `git config core.hooksPath`. It should output `.githooks`.\n\n2.  **Test Invalid Commit** (Should Fail):\n    Make a small change to a file, stage it, and try to commit with a non-compliant message:\n    ```bash\n    touch test_verify\n    git add test_verify\n    git commit -m \"saving changes\"\n    ```\n    *Expected Result:* The commit should be **rejected** with an error message from the `commit-msg` hook explaining the required format.\n\n3.  **Test Valid Commit** (Should Succeed):\n    Try again with the correct format:\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"chore(test): verify auto-commit hooks\"\n    ```\n    *Expected Result:* The commit should succeed.\n\n4.  **Clean Up**:\n    ```bash\n    git reset HEAD~1\n    rm test_verify\n    ```\n\nIf the AI fails to commit after a task, it is likely because the generated commit message did not match the regex pattern enforced by `.githooks/commit-msg`. The AI has been instructed in the rule to \"fix the issues and retry\" if this happens.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>","reasoning_details":[{"type":"reasoning.text","text":"**Investigating Auto-Commit Issues**\n\nI've been in Debug mode, and things are looking interesting.
