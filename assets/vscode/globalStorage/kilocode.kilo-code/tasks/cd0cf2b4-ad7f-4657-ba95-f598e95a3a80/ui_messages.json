From my knowledge of such videos, the setup commonly involves:\n\n- **Shell**: Zsh (Z shell) as the primary shell.\n- **Framework**: Oh My Zsh, a popular open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations.\n- **Theme**: Powerlevel10k, a fast and highly customizable theme for Zsh.\n- **Plugins**: Common ones include git, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and possibly others like zsh-completions or fzf.\n- **Terminal Emulator**: Often iTerm2 on macOS or Terminal.app, but the core config is shell-based.\n- **Fonts**: MesloLGS NF (Nerd Font patched) for icons and symbols in the prompt.\n- **Additional Tools**: May include tools like tmux for session management, but the video focuses on the shell prompt customization.\n\nIf the video content differs, the standard stack for such setups is Zsh + Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k, as you suspected. This is a common configuration for a modern, feature-rich terminal experience.\n\n### Recommended Files and Directories to Backup\nTo preserve your terminal configuration, backup the following files and directories relative to your home directory (~). These are the key locations for Zsh, Oh My Zsh, and Powerlevel10k setups. Use commands like `tar -czf backup.tar.gz ~/.zshrc ~/.p10k.zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom` to create an archive, or copy them to an external drive.\n\n- **~/.zshrc**: Main Zsh configuration file. Contains shell settings, aliases, environment variables, and plugin/theme loads.\n- **~/.p10k.zsh**: Powerlevel10k theme configuration file. Stores your prompt customization settings (colors, segments, icons).\n- **~/.oh-my-zsh/**: Entire Oh My Zsh directory. Includes built-in themes, plugins, and your customizations.\n  - Focus on **~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/**: Subdirectory for user-added plugins, themes, and aliases.\n- **~/.zsh_history** (optional): Command history file, if you want to preserve your command history.\n- **~/.fonts/** or system font directories: If you've installed custom fonts like MesloLGS NF, backup from ~/.fonts (Linux) or ~/Library/Fonts (macOS). On Linux, fonts might be in /usr/share/fonts or ~/.local/share/fonts.\n- **~/.tmux.conf** (if using tmux): Tmux configuration, as it's often part of terminal workflows.\n- **~/.config/** subdirectories: Check for terminal-specific configs, e.g., ~/.config/alacritty/ if using Alacritty, or ~/.config/kitty/ for Kitty terminal.\n- **~/.local/share/zsh/** or similar: If you've installed plugins manually outside Oh My Zsh.\n\nAfter backing up, note any system-wide settings (e.g., default shell via `chsh -s /bin/zsh`) or package manager installations (e.g., via Homebrew on macOS or apt on Linux for zsh, fonts). On the new OS install, reinstall Zsh, Oh My Zsh, and Powerlevel10k, then restore these files.","partial":false},{"ts":1764520863653,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"finishTask\"}","isProtected":false}]
