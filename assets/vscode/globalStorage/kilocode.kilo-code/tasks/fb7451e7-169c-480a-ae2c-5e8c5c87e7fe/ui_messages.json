[{"ts":1764568836034,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"[Memory Bank: Active]\n\nYou are in **Code mode** and being delegated a focused documentation task by Orchestrator mode.\n\nThe user request is: **“Update memory bank”** after we added EasyEffects presets and the new setup script.\n\nThe Memory Bank lives under [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank:1). You must **update it to reflect the current repository state**, especially the new EasyEffects integration, while respecting all Memory Bank rules.\n\nThese instructions **supersede any conflicting general Code-mode rules**.\n\n---\n\n## Context from recent work\n\nA previous Code-mode subtask already:\n\n- Added a new script:\n  - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)\n\n- Integrated it into the orchestrator:\n  - [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1) now:\n    - Invokes the EasyEffects setup script (after apps setup).\n    - Supports `--skip-easyeffects`.\n\n- Backed up current EasyEffects presets:\n  - [`assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G560.json`](assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G560.json:1) (Logitech G560 speakers)\n  - [`assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G435.json`](assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G435.json:1) (Logitech G435 headset)\n  - [`assets/.config/easyeffects/autoload/output/`](assets/.config/easyeffects/autoload/output:1) (autoload rules for automatic preset switching)\n\nCommit for that work:\n- `feat(audio): add easyeffects presets and setup script` (hash `e6e4e8c`)\n\nThe Memory Bank currently does **not** mention EasyEffects, and some of its “Next Steps” items (like initially adding `architecture.md` and `tech.md`) are now outdated.\n\n---\n\n## Scope of your work\n\nYou must:\n\n1. **Review Memory Bank files** (do not skip):\n   - [`memory-bank-instructions.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md:1)\n   - [`brief.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/brief.md:1) **(read-only; do NOT edit)**\n   - [`product.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md:1)\n   - [`context.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md:1)\n   - [`architecture.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1)\n   - [`tech.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md:1)\n   - [`tasks.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md:1) if it exists (optional file)\n\n2. **Update the Memory Bank content** to reflect:\n   - The existence and role of:\n     - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)\n     - [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1)\n     - The new `--skip-easyeffects` flag in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1).\n   - The fact that Memory Bank initialization (including `architecture.md` and `tech.md`) has already been done.\n   - The project’s **current state** after adding EasyEffects integration.\n\n3. **Keep `brief.md` unmodified.** The instructions explicitly state that `brief.md` is maintained manually by the developer; you must not edit it.\n\n4. **Commit the updated Memory Bank** following the Auto-Commit rule, then report via `attempt_completion`.\n\nDo **only** what is described here: reading and updating Memory Bank documentation and committing those doc changes. Do not modify scripts or other code for this task.\n\n---\n\n## Critical global rules to follow\n\n1. **Memory Bank conventions**\n\n   - At the start of this subtask, you must read all Memory Bank files listed above.\n   - Continue to treat the Memory Bank as the authoritative project reference.\n   - You are performing a **Memory Bank Update**, which per instructions means:\n     - Review existing documentation.\n     - Document current state, insights, and patterns.\n     - Ensure especially that `context.md` is accurate and up to date.\n\n2. **Code exploration rule**\n\n   - If you need to look again at repository code beyond the Memory Bank (for example, to confirm details in [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1) or [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1)), you **must**:\n     - Use `codebase_search` **first** to find relevant files.\n     - Then you may drill in further with other tools as needed.\n\n3. **One tool per message**\n\n   - Each of your messages must invoke **exactly one** tool (`codebase_search`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `execute_command`, etc.).\n\n4. **Auto-Commit Rule (critical)**\n\n   Before using `attempt_completion` in this subtask, you **must**:\n\n   - Ensure there are no broken states introduced by your documentation changes (no code changes here, so there are no tests to run beyond confirming files are valid text).\n   - Run:\n     - `git add .`\n     - `git commit -m \"docs(memory): update memory bank after easyeffects integration\"`\n   - If commit fails (e.g., hooks), fix issues and retry until it succeeds.\n   - Only after a **successful** commit can you call `attempt_completion`.\n\n5. **Clickable file references**\n\n   - In all Markdown responses (including inside `&lt;attempt_completion&gt;`), **every** file path you mention must be formatted as a clickable link with a `:line` anchor, for example:\n     - [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1)\n     - [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md:1)\n     - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)\n     - [`assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G560.json`](assets/.config/easyeffects/output/G560.json:1)\n\n---\n\n## Specific edits to make\n\nThese are explicit guidelines for each Memory Bank file. Use your judgment for exact wording, but keep it concise and factual.\n\n### 1) `product.md`\n\nFile: [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md:1)\n\n- Extend the **Scope** or a suitable section (e.g. “Applications and Services” if present) to mention that:\n  - The project now also ensures reproducible **audio processing** via EasyEffects presets.\n- Update the **“How It Should Work” / Typical Flow** section to briefly note that:\n  - [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1) now orchestrates an EasyEffects step via [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1) that installs EasyEffects and restores presets from [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1).\n\nKeep the tone and level of detail consistent with the existing `product.md`.\n\n### 2) `architecture.md`\n\nFile: [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1)\n\n- **Orchestration Flow section**:\n  - Update the numbered or ordered list of scripts run by [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1) to insert the EasyEffects step at the correct position.\n    - It should appear after apps setup and before completion, aligned with the actual code in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1).\n    - Make it clear that EasyEffects runs even in `--minimal` mode unless `--skip-easyeffects` is provided.\n\n- **Tooling and Apps Setup (External Integrations)**:\n  - Add a new bullet for:\n    - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)\n  - Describe responsibilities:\n    - Install EasyEffects via `dnf`.\n    - Restore presets and configuration from [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1) into `~/.config/easyeffects`.\n    - Optionally copy into Flatpak config path if `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/` exists.\n    - Integration with `--skip-easyeffects`.\n\n- **Assets and Configuration Layout**:\n  - Add mention of:\n    - [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1) as the source of truth for audio presets (e.g., G560 and G435) and autoload rules.\n\nEnsure these updates stay stylistically aligned with the existing sections.\n\n### 3) `tech.md`\n\nFile: [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md:1)\n\n- Under **Applications and Services**, add a bullet describing EasyEffects, for example:\n  - EasyEffects, installed via [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1), with presets/configuration under [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1), used to keep speaker/headphone audio tuning reproducible.\n\n- Under **Configuration and Assets**, add EasyEffects to the list of app configs under [`assets/.config/`](assets/.config:1), explicitly referencing:\n  - [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1)\n\n- If there is a suitable place (e.g. under “Technical Constraints and Patterns” or similar), you may briefly note that:\n  - Audio presets are managed like other configuration assets: stored in `assets/` and restored via a dedicated script.\n\n### 4) `context.md`\n\nFile: [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md:1)\n\n**This file must be brought up-to-date.** The current contents still talk about:\n\n- Initializing the Memory Bank.\n- Future work such as “Add architecture overview” and “Add tech summary” even though those files now exist and describe the current system.\n\nUpdate it to something like (adapt to actual structure):\n\n- **Current Work Focus**\n  - Maintaining the Memory Bank in sync with the evolving terminal setup scripts, including new integrations like EasyEffects audio presets.\n- **Recent Changes**\n  - Initialized the Memory Bank (brief, product, architecture, tech).\n  - Added Vietnamese input support via [`scripts/input_setup.sh`](scripts/input_setup.sh:1).\n  - Added EasyEffects integration:\n    - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)\n    - [`assets/.config/easyeffects`](assets/.config/easyeffects:1)\n    - `--skip-easyeffects` flag in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1).\n- **Next Steps**\n  - Keep Memory Bank updated when new tools/scripts are added.\n  - Optionally document repetitive workflows (e.g. “add new tool integration”) in a future [`tasks.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md:1) if/when needed.\n\nMake sure the text is concise, factual, and aligned with the Memory Bank guidance.\n\n### 5) `memory-bank-instructions.md` and `tasks.md`\n\n- [`memory-bank-instructions.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md:1)\n  - Likely does **not** require changes for this update; it describes the general process.\n  - Read it to ensure your changes remain compliant, but do not modify unless you find a clear, objective inconsistency.\n\n- [`tasks.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md:1)\n  - Only edit or create this if it already exists and requires a factual update.\n  - Since the user did **not** explicitly request adding a new task template here, you should **not** introduce a new `tasks.md` just for this update.\n\n---\n\n## Verification and Commit\n\nAfter making the documentation edits:\n\n1. Ensure there are no syntax issues (they are Markdown/text files only).\n2. Stage and commit:\n   - `git add .`\n   - `git commit -m \"docs(memory): update memory bank after easyeffects integration\"`\n\nIf hooks fail, fix issues and repeat until the commit is successful.\n\n---\n\n## Completion Requirements\n\nWhen finished, call `attempt_completion` with a `result` that:\n\n- Lists all Memory Bank files you modified with clickable links, e.g.:\n  - [`product.md`](.kilicode/rules/memory-bank/product.md:1)\n  - [`architecture.md`](.kilicode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1)\n  - [`tech.md`](.kilicode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md:1)\n  - [`context.md`](.kilicode/rules/memory-bank/context.md:1)\n- Summarizes the key changes you made to each file.\n- Confirms that:\n  - `brief.md` was left unchanged.\n  - The docs now describe EasyEffects integration accurately (script, assets, flags).\n  - The commit `docs(memory): update memory bank after easyeffects integration` was created successfully.\n\nDo not end your `attempt_completion` result with any questions; it must be a final, declarative summary of the Memory Bank update."},{"ts":1764568836061,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":32691,\"tokensOut\":176,\"cacheWrites\":10408,\"cacheReads\":22274,\"cost\":0.07625699999999999,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764568840478,"type":"say","say":"reasoning","text":"I need to update the Memory Bank to reflect the new EasyEffects integration.
