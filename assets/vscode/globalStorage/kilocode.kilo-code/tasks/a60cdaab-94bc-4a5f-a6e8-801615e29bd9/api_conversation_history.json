This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional. The memory bank files are located in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank` folder.\n  4 | \n  5 | When I start a task, I will include `[Memory Bank: Active]` at the beginning of my response if I successfully read the memory bank files, or `[Memory Bank: Missing]` if the folder doesn't exist or is empty. If memory bank is missing, I will warn the user about potential issues and suggest initialization.\n  6 | \n  7 | ## Memory Bank Structure\n  8 | \n  9 | The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format.\n 10 | \n 11 | ### Core Files (Required)\n 12 | 1. `brief.md`\n 13 |    This file is created and maintained manually by the developer. Don't edit this file directly but suggest to user to update it if it can be improved.\n 14 |    - Foundation document that shapes all other files\n 15 |    - Created at project start if it doesn't exist\n 16 |    - Defines core requirements and goals\n 17 |    - Source of truth for project scope\n 18 | \n 19 | 2. `product.md`\n 20 |    - Why this project exists\n 21 |    - Problems it solves\n 22 |    - How it should work\n 23 |    - User experience goals\n 24 | \n 25 | 3. `context.md`\n 26 |    This file should be short and factual, not creative or speculative.\n 27 |    - Current work focus\n 28 |    - Recent changes\n 29 |    - Next steps\n 30 | \n 31 | 4. `architecture.md`\n 32 |    - System architecture\n 33 |    - Source Code paths\n 34 |    - Key technical decisions\n 35 |    - Design patterns in use\n 36 |    - Component relationships\n 37 |    - Critical implementation paths\n 38 | \n 39 | 5. `tech.md`\n 40 |    - Technologies used\n 41 |    - Development setup\n 42 |    - Technical constraints\n 43 |    - Dependencies\n 44 |    - Tool usage patterns\n 45 | \n 46 | ### Additional Files\n 47 | Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:\n 48 | - `tasks.md` - Documentation of repetitive tasks and their workflows\n 49 | - Complex feature documentation\n 50 | - Integration specifications\n 51 | - API documentation\n 52 | - Testing strategies\n 53 | - Deployment procedures\n 54 | \n 55 | ## Core workflows\n 56 | \n 57 | ### Memory Bank Initialization\n 58 | \n 59 | The initialization step is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT and must be done with extreme thoroughness as it defines all future effectiveness of the Memory Bank. This is the foundation upon which all future interactions will be built.\n 60 | \n 61 | When user requests initialization of the memory bank (command `initialize memory bank`), I'll perform an exhaustive analysis of the project, including:\n 62 | - All source code files and their relationships\n 63 | - Configuration files and build system setup\n 64 | - Project structure and organization patterns\n 65 | - Documentation and comments\n 66 | - Dependencies and external integrations\n 67 | - Testing frameworks and patterns\n 68 | \n 69 | I must be extremely thorough during initialization, spending extra time and effort to build a comprehensive understanding of the project. A high-quality initialization will dramatically improve all future interactions, while a rushed or incomplete initialization will permanently limit my effectiveness.\n 70 | \n 71 | After initialization, I will ask the user to read through the memory bank files and verify product description, used technologies and other information. I should provide a summary of what I've understood about the project to help the user verify the accuracy of the memory bank files. I should encourage the user to correct any misunderstandings or add missing information, as this will significantly improve future interactions.\n 72 | \n 73 | ### Memory Bank Update\n 74 | \n 75 | Memory Bank updates occur when:\n 76 | 1. Discovering new project patterns\n 77 | 2. After implementing significant changes\n 78 | 3. When user explicitly requests with the phrase **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)\n 79 | 4. When context needs clarification\n 80 | \n 81 | If I notice significant changes that should be preserved but the user hasn't explicitly requested an update, I should suggest: \"Would you like me to update the memory bank to reflect these changes?\"\n 82 | \n 83 | To execute Memory Bank update, I will:\n 84 | \n 85 | 1. Review ALL project files\n 86 | 2. Document current state\n 87 | 3. Document Insights & Patterns\n 88 | 4. If requested with additional context (e.g., \"update memory bank using information from @/Makefile\"), focus special attention on that source\n 89 | \n 90 | Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on context.md as it tracks current state.\n 91 | \n 92 | ### Add Task\n 93 | \n 94 | When user completes a repetitive task (like adding support for a new model version) and wants to document it for future reference, they can request: **add task** or **store this as a task**.\n 95 | \n 96 | This workflow is designed for repetitive tasks that follow similar patterns and require editing the same files. Examples include:\n 97 | - Adding support for new AI model versions\n 98 | - Implementing new API endpoints following established patterns\n 99 | - Adding new features that follow existing architecture\n100 | \n101 | Tasks are stored in the file `tasks.md` in the memory bank folder. The file is optional and can be empty. The file can store many tasks.\n102 | \n103 | To execute Add Task workflow:\n104 | \n105 | 1. Create or update `tasks.md` in the memory bank folder\n106 | 2. Document the task with:\n107 |    - Task name and description\n108 |    - Files that need to be modified\n109 |    - Step-by-step workflow followed\n110 |    - Important considerations or gotchas\n111 |    - Example of the completed implementation\n112 | 3. Include any context that was discovered during task execution but wasn't previously documented\n113 | \n114 | Example task entry:\n115 | ```markdown\n116 | ## Add New Model Support\n117 | **Last performed:** [date]\n118 | **Files to modify:**\n119 | - `/providers/gemini.md` - Add model to documentation\n120 | - `/src/providers/gemini-config.ts` - Add model configuration\n121 | - `/src/constants/models.ts` - Add to model list\n122 | - `/tests/providers/gemini.test.ts` - Add test cases\n123 | \n124 | **Steps:**\n125 | 1. Add model configuration with proper token limits\n126 | 2. Update documentation with model capabilities\n127 | 3. Add to constants file for UI display\n128 | 4. Write tests for new model configuration\n129 | \n130 | **Important notes:**\n131 | - Check Google's documentation for exact token limits\n132 | - Ensure backward compatibility with existing configurations\n133 | - Test with actual API calls before committing\n134 | ```\n135 | \n136 | ### Regular Task Execution\n137 | \n138 | In the beginning of EVERY task I MUST read ALL memory bank files - this is not optional.\n139 | \n140 | The memory bank files are located in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank` folder. If the folder doesn't exist or is empty, I will warn user about potential issues with the memory bank. I will include `[Memory Bank: Active]` at the beginning of my response if I successfully read the memory bank files, or `[Memory Bank: Missing]` if the folder doesn't exist or is empty. If memory bank is missing, I will warn the user about potential issues and suggest initialization. I should briefly summarize my understanding of the project to confirm alignment with the user's expectations, like:\n141 | \n142 | \"[Memory Bank: Active] I understand we're building a React inventory system with barcode scanning. Currently implementing the scanner component that needs to work with the backend API.\"\n143 | \n144 | When starting a task that matches a documented task in `tasks.md`, I should mention this and follow the documented workflow to ensure no steps are missed.\n145 | \n146 | If the task was repetitive and might be needed again, I should suggest: \"Would you like me to add this task to the memory bank for future reference?\"\n147 | \n148 | In the end of the task, when it seems to be completed, I will update `context.md` accordingly. If the change seems significant, I will suggest to the user: \"Would you like me to update memory bank to reflect these changes?\" I will not suggest updates for minor changes.\n149 | \n150 | ## Context Window Management\n151 | \n152 | When the context window fills up during an extended session:\n153 | 1. I should suggest updating the memory bank to preserve the current state\n154 | 2. Recommend starting a fresh conversation/task\n155 | 3. In the new conversation, I will automatically load the memory bank files to maintain continuity\n156 | \n157 | ## Technical Implementation\n158 | \n159 | Memory Bank is built on Kilo Code's Custom Rules feature, with files stored as standard markdown documents that both the user and I can access.\n160 | \n161 | ## Important Notes\n162 | \n163 | REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.\n164 | \n165 | If I detect inconsistencies between memory bank files, I should prioritize brief.md and note any discrepancies to the user.\n166 | \n167 | IMPORTANT: I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional. The memory bank files are located in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank` folder.\n</content>\n</file>\n</files>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nREADME.md,src/characters/player/player.gd,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/progress.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/system.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md,docs/memory_bank_review.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/activeContext.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/brief.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/gameDesign.md,.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/gameDesign.md\n\n# Current Time\nCurrent time in ISO 8601 UTC format: 2025-11-28T19:40:00.442Z\nUser time zone: Asia/Saigon, UTC+7:00\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.00\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>code</slug>\n<name>Code</name>\n<model>x-ai/grok-code-fast-1</model>\nYou have not created a todo list yet.
