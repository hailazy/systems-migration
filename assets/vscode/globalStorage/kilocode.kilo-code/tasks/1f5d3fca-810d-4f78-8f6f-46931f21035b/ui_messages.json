They say to use codebase_search first for unexamined code, but this isn’t code. We have to follow the one tool per message rule, which means I can’t call read_file for multiple memory bank files and enhancement files in the same message.\n\nWait, I can use read_file with multiple files, but \"one tool per message\" means distinct tool types. I can consolidate file calls, but we need to consider reading all related files efficiently!\n\n**Analyzing file access requirements**\n\nI’m realizing I can perform two read_file calls over two messages since each message can use only one tool, which is allowed. However, the memory bank instructions say I must read all memory bank files at the start. So, the first call will read those five files. Then, I’ll need the user's feedback before calling read_file again for the four target files.\n\nBut there’s a global rule: for any code exploration, I must use codebase_search first. The user wants me to analyze specific scripts, even if that means following the code exploration rule.\n\n**Clarifying tool call sequence**\n\nI’m considering the instructions about codebase_search. I think we need to call it first to identify the relevant files since that's part of the requirements. But I also have to take care of the memory bank files first, even though they aren't code exploration tasks.\n\nSo, my first tool use will be read_file for the memory bank documents. After the user responds to that, I can choose to use either codebase_search or read_file next. Each message should include one tool call, even with additional commentary!\n\n**Understanding response channels**\n\nI’m figuring out the pattern regarding how we call tools in this environment. Typically, our \"assistant\" message in the analysis channel has to include reasoning. But the guidelines say we should respond with only tool tags initially.\n\nSo, I think our first response must be in the analysis channel, followed by an actual tool call in the final channel. I notice that the instructions don’t differentiate tool channels, but historically, analysis is for reasoning and final is for the actual tool call or final answer.\n\n**Outlining tool usage steps**\n\nI’m planning how to approach calling tools effectively. For tests and Git operations, I’ll only use execute_command when modifications are made to the repo, which seems more practical. Within docs mode, there are file editing restrictions, so I need to be careful.\n\nI’ll first use list_files to check the memory bank for all .md files since I need to read all of them before any code exploration. After that, I can call read_file and use codebase_search later for the scripts. Each message must contain a single tool call, ensuring I follow the structure correctly with user confirmation after each step.\n\n**Adjusting tool usage plan**\n\nI need to refine my approach for listing files in the memory bank. For step one, I’ll call list_files on .kilocode/rules/memory-bank with recursive set to true to ensure I capture any nested tasks. Although the main goal is to read top-level .md files, I want to confirm if there are additional folders or files that should be included.\n\nEven though there's a rule about using codebase_search first, I think the memory bank is separate from code exploration. So, I'll proceed with my plan and craft step one for the final message.","partial":false},{"ts":1764532345474,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"","partial":false},{"ts":1764532345580,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"22c52f97a2df44488de7e2b7e36021cbd12fc1be","checkpoint":{"from":"97866856e0f30eb90164c039b0464be3762cde65","to":"22c52f97a2df44488de7e2b7e36021cbd12fc1be","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764532345581,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"listFilesRecursive\",\"path\":\".kilocode/rules/memory-bank\",\"isOutsideWorkspace\":false,\"content\":\"🛡️ architecture.md\\n🛡️ brief.md\\n🛡️ context.md\\n🛡️ memory-bank-instructions.md\\n🛡️ product.md\\n🛡️ tech.md\"}","partial":false,"isProtected":false},{"ts":1764532345837,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":0,\"tokensOut\":0,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":0,\"cost\":0,\"usageMissing\":true}"},{"ts":1764532364582,"type":"say","say":"reasoning","text":"**Managing file analysis**\n\nI need to create a document by analyzing four files, which sounds multi-step but totally manageable.
