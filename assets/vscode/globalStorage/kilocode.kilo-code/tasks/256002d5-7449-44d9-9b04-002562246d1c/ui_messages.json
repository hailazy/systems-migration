Focusing on `product.md` initially, I've identified several areas needing attention. I will incorporate proper bullet points and address inconsistent header usage. Further updates will include attention to the list formatting, as well as fixing any inconsistent formatting.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Product Refinement**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the `product.md` file. I've successfully implemented bullet points for the lists, enhancing readability. My next step will involve addressing inconsistent header usage and ensuring a consistent structure throughout the file. I am looking forward to refining the overall flow of information, making it more user-friendly.\n\n\n**Analyzing File Structures**\n\nI've successfully updated `product.md` and am now turning my attention to `progress.md`. I will format the checklist, ensuring consistency with bullet points. I'll need to then address its header hierarchy and overall clarity, and will keep the focus on concise formatting.\n\n\n**Planning File Updates**\n\nI've reviewed `product.md` and `progress.md`, and am ready to address `system.md` next.

After that, I will move on to the file detailing the project's technical specifications.\n\n\n**Planning System Refinement**\n\nI'm now shifting focus to `system.md`, aiming to format its folder structure using code blocks and improve the overall list formatting. Subsequently, I'll update the technical specifications, ensuring consistency in the formatting and that bullet points are used throughout. This will involve the use of code blocks.\n\n\n**Implementing System Updates**\n\nI've successfully incorporated the code blocks and formatting changes to `system.md` as planned, increasing its readability. Now, I will focus on updating the technical standards section, ensuring the bullet point usage is consistent.\n\n\n**Finalizing Tech.md Updates**\n\nI've updated `system.md` and can now move on to `tech.md`.

After this update, my next step will be creating `activeContext.md` to track current sessions, and I plan to do so immediately after.\n\n\n**Applying Updated Formats**\n\nI've successfully updated `product.md`, `progress.md`, `system.md`, and `tech.md`, ensuring all requested format refinements.

My current thinking is that the pre-commit hook is still detecting whitespace, even after my attempts to remove it.
