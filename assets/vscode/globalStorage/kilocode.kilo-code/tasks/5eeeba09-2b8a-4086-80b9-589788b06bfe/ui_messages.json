Here is a concise summary of what was done and how README now reflects the EasyEffects feature and all relevant flags.\n\n## 1. Analysis of Existing Docs and Scripts\n\nI reviewed:\n\n- The main documentation in [`README.md`](README.md).\n- The EasyEffects integration script [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh).\n- The orchestrator and related scripts:\n  - [`setup.sh`](setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/core_setup.sh`](scripts/core_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh)\n  - [`scripts/vscode_setup.sh`](scripts/vscode_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/qdrant_setup.sh`](scripts/qdrant_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/godot_setup.sh`](scripts/godot_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/apps_setup.sh`](scripts/apps_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/packettracer_setup.sh`](scripts/packettracer_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/input_setup.sh`](scripts/input_setup.sh)\n\nFindings specific to EasyEffects:\n\n- `setup.sh` supports a `--skip-easyeffects` flag and, by default, runs [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) as part of the full install.\n- [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) does the following:\n  - Installs `easyeffects` via `dnf_install`.\n  - Restores presets and config from `assets/.config/easyeffects` into `~/.config/easyeffects`.\n  - If Flatpak EasyEffects exists at `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects`, it also copies presets into that per-app config path.\n  - Presets include device-specific profiles (G560, G435) and **autoload rules** so presets switch automatically when devices change.\n  - Prints guidance on launching EasyEffects and selecting/using presets.\n- README previously:\n  - Did not mention EasyEffects at all.\n  - Did not document `--skip-easyeffects`.\n  - Did not list `easyeffects_setup.sh` in the scripts tree.\n  - Had no “What Gets Installed” subsection for EasyEffects.\n  - Had no example for running `easyeffects_setup.sh` directly.\n\n## 2. README Updates for EasyEffects\n\nI updated [`README.md`](README.md) in several places to surface the EasyEffects feature clearly.\n\n### 2.1 Features List\n\nIn the **Features** section, I:\n\n- Left existing items intact.\n- Added EasyEffects as an explicit feature.\n- Also made the power tools list more accurate by including `ripgrep` and `fd-find` (which are actually installed by [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh)).\n\nBefore (power tools & no audio):\n\n- `**Power Tools**: zoxide, eza, bat, fzf, lazygit, yazi`\n- No audio entry.\n\nAfter:\n\n- `**Power Tools**: zoxide, eza, bat, fzf, ripgrep, fd-find, lazygit, yazi`\n- Added:\n  - `**Audio Processing**: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets and autoload rules`\n\nThis makes it clear that the environment includes a tuned audio processing pipeline, not just visual and terminal tooling.\n\n### 2.2 Usage / Options: `--skip-easyeffects`\n\nIn the **Usage** block that documents `./setup.sh [OPTIONS]`, I:\n\n- Kept all existing flags.\n- Updated the `--enhance` description to include the full power-tool list (`ripgrep`, `fd-find`) to match the implementation in [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh).\n- Added the missing EasyEffects flag:\n\n```text\n--skip-easyeffects  Skip EasyEffects audio setup\n```\n\nSo the options list now matches `show_help()` in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) with respect to EasyEffects.\n\n### 2.3 Project Structure: Scripts List\n\nIn the **Project Structure** section, under `scripts/`, I:\n\n- Inserted the missing EasyEffects script:\n\n```text\n├── easyeffects_setup.sh    # EasyEffects audio presets and configuration\n```\n\nThe list now mirrors the actual contents of `scripts/` as confirmed by the directory listing.\n\n### 2.4 “What Gets Installed”: EasyEffects Section\n\nUnder **What Gets Installed**, I added a new subsection:\n\n```markdown\n### EasyEffects Audio Setup (`easyeffects_setup.sh`)\n- Installs EasyEffects via DNF\n- Restores audio presets and configuration from `assets/.config/easyeffects` into `~/.config/easyeffects`\n- If Flatpak EasyEffects is installed, also syncs presets to `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects`\n- Includes pre-tuned output presets (e.g., G560 speakers, G435 headset)\n- Includes autoload rules so presets switch automatically based on the active audio device\n```\n\nThis describes:\n\n- **What** the script installs.\n- **Where** presets come from and are placed.\n- **How** the Flatpak integration behaves.\n- **Which devices** have custom tuning (G560, G435).\n- **Why** it matters (automatic preset switching via autoload rules).\n\n### 2.5 Individual Script Usage: EasyEffects\n\nIn the **Individual Script Usage** section, I added a direct invocation example for EasyEffects:\n\n```bash\n# Run only EasyEffects audio setup\nbash scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern already used for other feature scripts and allows users to re-apply or re-sync audio presets independently of the full `setup.sh` flow.\n\n## 3. Audit of README Against All Scripts\n\nI cross-checked README against:\n\n- Flags and flow in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh).\n- Behavior of all setup scripts under `scripts/`.\n\nFindings and resolutions:\n\n1. **EasyEffects flag and script**\n   - `--skip-easyeffects` existed in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) but was not documented.\n   - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) existed but was not listed in the project structure, had no “What Gets Installed” entry, and no individual usage example.\n   - These are now fully documented as described above.\n\n2. **Power tools list for `--enhance`**\n   - [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh) installs:\n     - `zoxide`, `eza`, `bat`, `fzf`, `ripgrep`, `fd-find` via DNF.\n     - `lazygit` via COPR.\n     - `yazi` via a prebuilt binary.\n   - README’s Features and Usage texts previously omitted `ripgrep` and `fd-find`.\n   - I updated:\n     - The **Features** bullet to include `ripgrep`, `fd-find`.\n     - The `--enhance` description in the **Usage** section to match the actual set of tools.\n\n3. **Other scripts and behaviors**\n   - `--minimal`, `--skip-vscode`, `--skip-qdrant`, `--skip-godot`, `--skip-apps`, `--skip-packettracer`, `--vietnamese`, and `--enhance` were already documented in README and match the argument parsing in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh).\n   - README already documented:\n     - `GODOT_VERSION` environment variable and `--uninstall` for Godot.\n     - `--uninstall` for Packet Tracer.\n     - Qdrant behavior (Podman service, ports).\n     - VS Code behavior (settings, extensions, Kilo Code global storage).\n     - Apps, Packet Tracer, and Vietnamese input setup.\n   - No additional flags or modes beyond EasyEffects were missing from the README.\n\nNet result: README is now aligned with all current scripts and flags.\n\n## 4. Verification and Commit\n\nTo ensure a clean change, I:\n\n1. Ran a Bash syntax check on the orchestrator and all scripts:\n\n   ```bash\n   bash -n setup.sh scripts/*.sh\n   ```\n\n   This completed successfully (exit code 0).\n\n2. Staged and committed the documentation update:\n\n   ```bash\n   git add README.md\n   git commit -m \"docs(readme): document EasyEffects audio setup\"\n   ```\n\n   The commit succeeded and includes only the README changes (15 insertions, 2 deletions).\n\n## 5. Summary of User-Visible Changes\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, the documentation now:\n\n- Clearly advertises **EasyEffects** in the Features list as “Audio Processing: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets and autoload rules”.\n- Documents the **`--skip-easyeffects`** flag alongside other CLI options.\n- Shows **`easyeffects_setup.sh`** in the scripts tree with a short description.\n- Provides a dedicated **“EasyEffects Audio Setup”** section under “What Gets Installed” explaining:\n  - Installation.\n  - Preset locations.\n  - Flatpak integration.\n  - Device-specific tuning (G560, G435).\n  - Automatic preset switching.\n- Includes an **individual script usage example** for running just the EasyEffects setup.\n- Aligns the documented power tools for `--enhance` with the actual tools installed (`ripgrep`, `fd-find` included).\n\nThe README is now up-to-date with the EasyEffects feature and remains consistent with all existing scripts and flags in this repository."},{"ts":1764572487028,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":26845,\"tokensOut\":443,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":20284,\"cost\":0.018438,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764572490070,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"","partial":false},{"ts":1764572490375,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"79f0977321813a15d2651095a5ad40309002cfb4","checkpoint":{"from":"695185e79336ae4d991d406b518cbbbcb151ae2d","to":"79f0977321813a15d2651095a5ad40309002cfb4","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764572490377,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"updateTodoList\",\"todos\":[{\"id\":\"83d5fb430942c73dda2d61b086c4dc42\",\"content\":\"Delegate to docs-specialist to analyze README.md and scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"386bf1a46d798c393f145d40b87b2e73\",\"content\":\"Delegate to docs-specialist to update README.md with EasyEffects info\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"a8220a65da060fdc2b6bd0484bedaee4\",\"content\":\"Delegate to docs-specialist to audit README.md against all scripts for other missing info\",\"status\":\"completed\"}]}","partial":false,"isProtected":false},{"ts":1764572491272,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":27335,\"tokensOut\":278,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":24307,\"cost\":0.009392,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764572497145,"type":"say","say":"text","text":""},{"ts":1764572497223,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"30523194978e872a13c05910c2bceea7954621e3","checkpoint":{"from":"79f0977321813a15d2651095a5ad40309002cfb4","to":"30523194978e872a13c05910c2bceea7954621e3","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764572497225,"type":"say","say":"completion_result","text":"I have updated the `README.md` to include comprehensive information about EasyEffects and corrected other missing details found during the audit.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n\n1.  **EasyEffects Documentation:**\n    *   **Features List:** Added \"Audio Processing: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets and autoload rules\".\n    *   **Usage Options:** Documented the `--skip-easyeffects` flag.\n    *   **Project Structure:** Added `easyeffects_setup.sh` to the file tree.\n    *   **Detailed Description:** Added a new \"EasyEffects Audio Setup\" section explaining installation, preset restoration (including G560/G435 tuning), and Flatpak integration.\n    *   **Individual Usage:** Added a command example for running `scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh` directly.\n\n2.  **Audit Corrections:**\n    *   **Power Tools:** Updated the list of power tools in both the Features and Usage sections to include `ripgrep` and `fd-find`, which are installed by the enhancement script but were previously missing from the documentation.\n\nThe `README.md` now accurately reflects the current state of the project's scripts and capabilities.","partial":false},{"ts":1764572499859,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""}]
