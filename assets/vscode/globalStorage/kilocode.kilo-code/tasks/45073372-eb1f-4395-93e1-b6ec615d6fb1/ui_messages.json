They definitely need markdown formatting!  I'm now delegating the file cleanup and initializations to the `docs-specialist` mode.

Next, I'll direct the `docs-specialist` mode to clean up the Markdown formatting and potentially initialize `activeContext.md` if it seems relevant. Finally, I will call on the Architect for design improvements.\n\n\n**Examining File Content**\n\nI'm now employing `read_file` to thoroughly review the memory bank files: `product.md`, `progress.md`, `system.md`, and `tech.md`. I want to understand their current state before delegating any tasks. I anticipate the formatting to be subpar, given the user's prompt.
