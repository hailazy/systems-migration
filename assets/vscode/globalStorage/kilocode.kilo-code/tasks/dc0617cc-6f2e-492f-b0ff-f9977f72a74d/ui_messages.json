Project Analysis\n\nUsing the existing documentation and scripts, I analyzed:\n\n- [`README.md`](README.md:1) — overall purpose, features, usage, project structure.\n- [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1) — master orchestrator, argument parsing, flow control.\n- Core scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts:1), especially:\n  - [`scripts/common.sh`](scripts/common.sh:1)\n  - [`scripts/core_setup.sh`](scripts/core_setup.sh:1)\n  - [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh:1)\n- Configuration and assets under [`assets/`](assets:1).\n\nFrom this, the understanding captured in the Memory Bank is:\n\n- This repo is a **scripted environment bootstrap** for Nobara 42 / Fedora-based systems.\n- It installs and configures:\n  - Zsh, Starship, Atuin, Fastfetch, Kitty, tmux, power tools (zoxide, eza, bat, fzf, ripgrep, fd-find, lazygit, yazi).\n  - VS Code, Qdrant, Godot, Chrome/Dropbox/Flatpak apps, Cisco Packet Tracer.\n- All **user-specific configuration** (dotfiles, fonts, app configs) lives in [`assets/`](assets:1).\n- [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1) calls into modular scripts in [`scripts/`](scripts:1) and is controlled with flags like `--minimal`, `--enhance`, and `--skip-*`.\n\nThis analysis directly informed all Memory Bank files.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Memory Bank Directory\n\nThe Memory Bank directory now exists with all required core files:\n\n- `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`\n  - [`brief.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/brief.md:1)\n  - [`product.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md:1)\n  - [`context.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/context.md:1)\n  - [`architecture.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1)\n  - [`tech.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md:1)\n  - [`memory-bank-instructions.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md:1) (existing instructions file)\n\nThese are now the canonical Memory Bank for future sessions.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Minimally interactive setup.\n  4. Version-controlled customization that can evolve safely.\n- **Scope / Out of Scope**:\n  - In-scope: shell, terminal UX, power tools, editor/tooling, fonts.\n  - Out-of-scope: distro upgrades, non-Fedora systems, secrets/SSH keys, ad-hoc configs not tracked here.\n- **Success Criteria**:\n  - Fresh system reaches a familiar environment via `./setup.sh`.\n  - Rerunning scripts is safe (idempotent enough; backups).\n  - Configuration is centralized here.\n\nThis file is the conceptual foundation for the rest of the Memory Bank.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 `product.md`\n\nFile: [`product.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/product.md:1)\n\nDescribes the **product-level intent and UX**:\n\n- **Why it exists / Problems solved**:\n  - Time-consuming, error-prone manual setup of shell, fonts, themes, etc.\n  - Difficult to recreate a tuned environment on new machines.\n  - Configuration drift between systems.\n- **Solutions**:\n  - Single source of truth in [`assets/`](../../assets:1) and scripts in [`scripts/`](../../scripts:1).\n  - Orchestrated end-to-end setup via [`setup.sh`](../../setup.sh:1).\n- **How it should work (Typical Flow)**:\n  1.

It is widely considered the standard for Vietnamese Linux users.\n*   **Desktop Environment:** Nobara's default desktop is **GNOME**, which uses **IBus** natively. `ibus-bamboo` integrates perfectly with the system UI.\n*   **Gaming (Crucial for Nobara):** `ibus-bamboo` has a specific **Game Mode** (toggle with `Shift + ~`) that temporarily disables the input method. This prevents the input engine from interfering with game controls (like WASD) or in-game chat, which is a common issue with other input methods.\n\n### **Alternative for KDE Users: `fcitx5-bamboo`**\n\nIf you are using the **KDE Plasma** version of Nobara, **Fcitx5** is often preferred over IBus for better Wayland compatibility.\n*   **Recommendation:** `fcitx5-bamboo` (brings the Bamboo engine to Fcitx5) or `fcitx5-unikey`.\n\n---\n\n### **Installation Instructions**\n\nYou can install it directly via the terminal.\n\n**1. Install `ibus-bamboo`:**\n```bash\nsudo dnf install ibus-bamboo\n```\n*(If it's not in the default repos, you may need to enable the COPR: `sudo dnf copr enable lamngu/ibus-bamboo`)*\n\n**2. Configure:**\n1.  Open **Settings** > **Keyboard**.\n2.  Under **Input Sources**, click **+**.\n3.  Search for **Vietnamese** and select **Vietnamese (Bamboo)**.\n4.  (Optional) Restart IBus if it doesn't appear immediately: `ibus restart`.\n\n**3.
