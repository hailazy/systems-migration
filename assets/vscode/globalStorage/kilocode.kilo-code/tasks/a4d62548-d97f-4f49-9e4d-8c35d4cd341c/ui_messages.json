First, I’ll initialize the git repository in the current project directory with a command like `git init`, ensuring to include the `.gitignore` file. Next, I’ll create a `README.md` file based on the provided description. Then, I’ll stage and commit the files, possibly setting the default branch to \"main.\" Finally, I should clarify if there's a remote origin, though I can proceed without it for now while updating the TODO list.\n\n**Creating a Git checklist**\n\nI’m making a checklist for the tasks: First, I’ll initialize the Git repository. Then, I’ll create a `README.md` file using the provided content. Next, I’ll add and commit both the `README` and any existing files. Optionally, I could set the default branch to \"main\" and verify that the `.gitignore` or any necessary LFS is in place. After this, I need to provide a final status. I’ll start with the `update_todo_list` tool to create the list, as each message must include a tool call.\n\n**Clarifying task delegation**\n\nWhen I call `new_task` to create tasks in code mode, it seems this will trigger a prompt for that agent. The system notes that after tool use, the user will respond with the result, but not specifically the subtask's outcome. I think the `new_task` tool just creates a new task instance for the code mode agent to carry out actions. I’ll need to follow a step-by-step process, so first, I'll create a TODO list using `update_todo_list`, then wait for the user's confirmation of success.\n\n**Planning tool usage**\n\nI see that according to the system, the user needs to respond after each tool is used, which means I can't chain further actions until I get that confirmation. To keep things efficient, it looks like I need to minimize steps while using only one tool per message. So, I’ll start with `update_todo_list` in the first message. After the user confirms, I’ll follow up with `new_task` to create a task in code mode for initializing Git and creating the README. It seems I’ll need to craft specific instructions for that next step!\n\n**Formatting tool usage and plan**\n\nThe system requires that any language constructs or filenames must be clickable in a specific format. For instance, if I mention `README.md`, it should look like this: [`README.md`](README.md). But if I reference a function or a Git command, it should follow the format of [`functionName()`](relative/file/path.ext:line). Since I have to use a tool in each message, I’ll start with `update_todo_list` to provide my plan. After that, I’ll wait for the user’s confirmation before moving forward with the code mode tasks.\n\n**Formulating new task instructions**\n\nFor the next message, I’ll create a `new_task` in Code mode, instructing it to perform several steps: initialize Git, set the default branch to \"main,\" create a `README.md` with the provided content, and stage the `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.gitattributes` before committing. I need to pay attention to how I present commands because they need to be clickable. Since commands can be considered language constructs, I’ll describe them in prose without backticks to avoid formatting issues. Once the code task is complete, the next step will be to wait for the user's confirmation before proceeding.\n\n**Planning README creation**\n\nI’m preparing to finalize the instructions for `new_task` in Code mode. We need to create a README for the \"Chimera Protocol\" game project with a brief description. I’ll establish a structure while ensuring all file references are clickable, like [`project.godot`](project.godot). Since I can’t reference commands as code, I’ll describe necessary actions instead. The task includes checking for an existing `.git` directory, setting the branch name to \"main,\" and creating the `README.md` accordingly. This will help keep everything organized and ensure clarity in the instructions.\n\n**Creating README content**\n\nI’m working on producing the content for the README in a multi-line format without code blocks. It seems I can include Markdown headings like ‘##’ without them being classified as language constructs. The structure will have a title and quick start instructions, and I’ll list directory structures with clickable links for files like [`src/`](src/) and [`assets/`](assets/). I also need to instruct the Code mode to proceed step-by-step and confirm actions. While the user communicated in Vietnamese, I’ll respond in English as per their custom instructions unless stated otherwise.\n\n**Crafting the New Task Message**\n\nI’m preparing the message to create a new Git repository and add a minimal README. I need to be straightforward, so I'll use a direct tone while following the \"MARKDOWN RULES\" for clickable language constructs and filename references, like [`README.md`](README.md) and [`project.godot`](project.godot). The steps will include initializing Git, creating the README, and committing changes. I’ll also mention delegating to Code mode for execution. The workspace is the project root, avoiding the full path to streamline the instructions.","partial":false},{"ts":1764187879597,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"Delegating to Code mode to initialize Git for this project and create the README file as requested.","partial":false},{"ts":1764187879862,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"2bd2933b391c5a7ef1489be93f9b47223a43bde2","checkpoint":{"from":"af141f8e5d837da9b5ce591535254286f55374fa","to":"2bd2933b391c5a7ef1489be93f9b47223a43bde2","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764187879865,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"newTask\",\"mode\":\"Code\",\"content\":\"Subtask: Initialize Git repository and create the README for the Chimera Protocol project.\\n\\nContext:\\n- Project name: Chimera Protocol\\n- Temporary description (to be placed in the README): A mature pixel-art RPG set in a parasite-infested wasteland.

This means I can't just mention filenames casually—they have to be formatted correctly with the proper link structure. The requirement that line numbers are mandatory for language constructs but optional for filenames is something I need to keep in mind.\n\n**Formatting project files correctly**\n\nIn our message, I need to mention files like README.md, .gitignore, .gitattributes, and project.godot, ensuring I wrap them in the proper clickable format, such as [README.md](README.md) and [`.gitignore`](.gitignore).

I’ll format filenames like [README.md](README.md). It’s important not to include extra clickable items for code lines, as that's unnecessary. I'll create attempt_completion with results that state I've initialized a Git repository with the main branch, created README.md, and committed various files with the provided commit message. Bullet lists are okay, but I'll keep the formatting light. I will ensure filenames are clickable per the Markdown rules.\n\n**Crafting the final attempt completion**\n\nI need to create a final attempt_completion message noting that the Git repository has been initialized with the main branch. I’ll mention the creation of [README.md](README.md), stage it and other files like [`.gitignore`](.gitignore), and record the commit message. The operation is idempotent, and I'll include the commit hash and confirm the branch. I'm also mindful to keep the message concise, avoiding extra disclaimers.
