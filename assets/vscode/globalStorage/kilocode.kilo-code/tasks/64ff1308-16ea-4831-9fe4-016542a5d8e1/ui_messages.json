I wonder if we can just check with `git status`. Still, they emphasize verifying that all tests pass. I’m considering if running `bash -n setup.sh` could help ensure nothing's broken, even if we didn’t change it. Although it feels a bit extra, it might be okay since `bash -n` allows for syntax checks without executing commands, which seems harmless.\n\n**Evaluating verification steps**\n\nI’m thinking we don’t need to double-check since it’s just a documentation change, but the rule states we must ensure the code's stability. We could interpret verification as running `git diff` or using tools like `markdownlint`, though that could add complexity. I see \"code\" as including documentation, so verifying that shouldn't be necessary. Still, I plan to run `git status` to confirm only the README changed. Then we’ll proceed with `git add .` and commit the changes. After that, I’ll use `codebase_search` for the README and necessary scripts, while keeping in mind we should also review all scripts in the folder.\n\n**Planning script verification**\n\nI'm considering that I may need to use `list_files` for the scripts directory and potentially read each file or use `search_files`. It seems more efficient to first run `codebase_search`, and then follow up with `list_files` to identify script files. Even though we have some information stored, I think relying on the actual state is crucial, plus there may be new scripts. I’ll need to break my process into steps: initiating `codebase_search`, then `read_file`, followed by the rest in the order specified. I want to stay compliant with the guidelines for using each tool effectively.\n\n**Formatting requirements for links**\n\nI need to ensure that any filename or language construct I mention is clickable, formatted exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line). This adds a layer of complexity! For instance, if I reference `README`, I'll format it as [`README.md`](README.md). If I talk about a script like `scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh` at line 1, I should say `[bash.someFunction()](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1)`. I think it’d be prudent to include line numbers regularly, even though it's optional for filename links. So, I’ll stick to the simpler format where possible!\n\n**Structuring responses for task auditing**\n\nI’ve got to ensure any syntax constructs or filename references are clickable, formatted correctly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line), and this applies to all responses. I need to avoid chatting casually and follow a structured plan. First, I’ll call `update_todo_list` to set tasks before using `codebase_search` to locate files like README. Then, I’ll read relevant files and use `list_files` to identify all scripts. After that, I'll verify what flags and features are documented in the README versus the scripts while being thorough about missing details.\n\n**Organizing tool usage for tasks**\n\nI have a clear list of tools I’ll need to use for this project. First up is `update_todo_list` to create tasks, followed by `codebase_search` for initial discovery. After that, I’ll read files like `README.md` and `scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`, ensuring I stay within the five-file limit. For auditing, I'll also need `list_files` to identify scripts and potentially `search_files` for specific flags. Finally, I’ll apply changes and run tests before executing commands for `git add .` and `git commit`. It's important to follow the structure so it flows smoothly, ensuring to handle any potential complications along the way with clear communication to the user.\n\n**Deciding on git commands and requirements**\n\nI’m considering how to advise the user to maintain a clean working tree without asking unnecessary questions. I should run `git status --short` early to display modifications. While we eventually need to run `git add .`, we’re focusing on executing all commands in one sequence before the completion step (i.e., tests, staging, committing). Since our task is only modifying the `README.md`, it’s crucial to ensure everything is stable. I need to follow all guidelines while ensuring all file names and language constructs are clickable as specified.\n\n**Planning README modifications**\n\nI need to ensure that any filename reference or language construct is clickable when updating the README, but I can avoid referencing specific functions or CLI flags as language constructs. It’s a bit tricky, but I might link them to something like `setup.sh:1`. To get the correct line numbers, I’ll call `read_file` once, which helps with linking before any changes are made. My plan is to analyze the README structure first, look for sections, and then add a new section for \"EasyEffects audio presets.\" The first step is to update the todo list.","partial":false},{"ts":1764572148977,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"[Memory Bank: Active] I’ve loaded the project’s memory bank and understand this repo is a scripted setup for a Nobara/Fedora dev environment, orchestrated by [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) with feature-specific scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts).

I should also compare the README against all scripts in the scripts directory. I know there's a partial listing, but I also want to make sure scripts like easyeffects_setup.sh and core_setup.sh are included in the project structure section. Before diving into a new code area, I'll have to run a codebase_search, even though we haven’t had great luck with it yet.\n\n**Planning the codebase_search**\n\nI’m considering running a new codebase_search with the query \"scripts directory list\" before using list_files. While list_files isn't strictly necessary since the environment details are truncated, we don't have a complete listing of the scripts yet. It’s safer to use a more general query like \"scripts directory contents,\" although I worry about the effectiveness of semantic search. It seems we’ve already run a codebase_search for this area, but I think we might need another one to get relevant files for our audit of the README. Once we have the output, we can decide if we need to call list_files or read_file.\n\n**Reviewing EasyEffects and flags**\n\nI've covered the necessary EasyEffects and CLI flags, which include --minimal, --enhance, and others like --skip-easyeffects. Some script-specific flags exist too, like --uninstall for godot_setup.sh and packettracer_setup.sh. However, I'll need to audit the README against all scripts in the directory to find any other missing features or flags. Currently, it lists some scripts but omits easyeffects_setup.sh and the --skip-easyeffects flag. Plus, the usage options in the README need to be consistent with what's in the setup.sh file.\n\n**Updating documentation for EasyEffects**\n\nThe \"What gets installed\" list currently lacks a section for EasyEffects setup, so I'll need to add one titled \"### Audio / EasyEffects Setup (easyeffects_setup.sh).\" This section should describe how it installs EasyEffects using dnf_install, moves presets from assets/.config/easyeffects to /.config/easyeffects, and includes output presets for G560 speakers and G435 headphones. I also want to mention auto-load rules. Under \"Features,\" I might add a bullet point for \"EasyEffects audio processing with presets.\" Plus, I should update the assets tree and scripts tree to reflect these changes.\n\n**Planning the codebase_search and file exploration**\n\nI’m thinking about running a codebase_search for files like \"easyeffects_setup.sh,\" \"apps_setup.sh,\" and \"core_setup.sh,\" even though we already know they exist. The instructions say we should use codebase_search for any new area, which makes me think that even examining qdrant_setup.sh requires it. However, for a thorough audit, we definitely want to scan for CLI flags in each script, although many might just have the 'uninstall' argument. \n\nTo streamline my process, I’ll focus on commands like 'case \"$1\"' to find relevant script-level flag definitions. I’ll do a codebase_search using queries like \"uninstall\" and \"getopts.\" It seems we’ve already fulfilled the requirement for the EasyEffects area, so I can use read_file on other scripts while staying within the guidelines. Next, I'll call list_files to get the top-level scripts, which could reveal others not mentioned in the README.\n\n**Considering clickable references**\n\nI need to remember to include clickable file references formatted as [\\`filename\\`](path:line) style. I should also think about modifications for the README files too. There’s a bit of a process here, as I’ll need to call list_files for the scripts.

I've already checked easyeffects_setup and related setups, but need to focus on qdrant_setup, vscode_setup, and packettracer_setup. The README doesn't mention common utilities often, which is a bit odd. Flags like --skip-easyeffects are present in setup.sh but aren't mentioned in usage. Also, I need to check if the packettracer script supports other flags, too. It's essential to inspect everything thoroughly!\n\n**Planning code exploration steps**\n\nOh, I just realized I didn't follow the guideline to use the `codebase_search` tool before examining those five script files—I really need to keep that in mind! Moving forward, I'll make sure to use it first when exploring new code like qdrant_setup.sh, vscode_setup.sh, and packettracer_setup.sh. \n\nSo, my next steps are to analyze and then run codebase_search with a query about the qdrant setup script and its flags. After that, I’ll read the relevant files and update the README, adding a new bullet about EasyEffects and aligning it with the architecture details.\n\n**Updating README sections**\n\nI’m planning to update the README documentation now. For the Usage options section, I’ll add `--skip-easyeffects` with a short description since it seems crucial to mention at the beginning as well. \n\nIn the Project Structure section, I'll append the line for `easyeffects_setup.sh`, placing it appropriately to maintain order with the setup flow.

I'll include details like installing with dnf and copying presets, which ties into the specific speakers mentioned.\n\n**Updating README and scripting instructions**\n\nI’m planning to enhance the \"Individual Script Usage\" section in the README by including details on running `bash scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`, and I might add a mention of the `--skip-easyeffects` flag. This flag is part of the usage in the setup script, and it's important to clarify how to skip audio processing.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check for any missing options. It seems like `--skip-easyeffects` is not mentioned in the README, while `--skip-packettracer` is. I also want to confirm if the README references EasyEffects in the features bullet list.

The `--vietnamese` flag is set, but there’s no `--skip-vietnamese`. I see `godot_setup.sh` supports `--uninstall`, as noted in the README. I checked lines 175-176 for running the uninstall command and found uninstall details in `packettracer_setup.sh` too. I'm also confirming if there are environment variables for Qdrant and VS Code, but they don’t seem to require any. Only `godot_setup.sh` uses environment variables, and I'm gathering whether `input_setup.sh`, `enhance_terminal.sh`, or others have any CLI flags.\n\n**Enhancing documentation clarity**\n\nI think it’s important to include information about EasyEffects in the \"What Gets Installed\" section, along with mentioning it in the Features. I could create a new heading called \"EasyEffects Audio Presets,\" describing its functionality. Cross-checking the README, I see bullet items on lines 7-18 that could highlight \"**Audio Processing**: EasyEffects with presets for speakers/headset (G560, G435) and autoload rules.\" In the Project Structure, under assets/.config, I should update the comment to include 'easyeffects' alongside 'starship, atuin, fastfetch, kitty,' for clarity without listing everything.\n\n**Adding EasyEffects to installation details**\n\nIn the \"What Gets Installed\" section, I see we have several setups listed like \"Core Setup\" and \"Terminal Enhancement.\" I want to add a new entry for \"EasyEffects Setup (`easyeffects_setup.sh`)\" with bullet points summarizing its features. The clickable format is crucial, so I should ensure that any script references, like [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh:1), are correctly formatted in the README. However, I can't modify the README itself this way since it’s a plain text file, and the clickable annotations apply only to my markdown responses.\n\n**Planning README modifications**\n\nI need to ensure that any references in my narrative explanation are formatted as clickable. Next, I'll edit the README using an apply_diff method, as I know the complete file content and line numbers. It’s important to mark a TODO for updates after my analysis is complete. While it could be helpful to call update_todo_list before making changes, it’s not strictly necessary. I want to keep my modifications clear, starting with adding a feature bullet for EasyEffects, in the existing features list from lines 7-18.\n\n**Updating README structure**\n\nI’m planning to add an entry for EasyEffects in the README under \"What Gets Installed.\" I think a bullet point summarizing its features like preconfigured presets for Logitech speakers and headset would fit nicely there. I’ll also enhance the options list by inserting a flag for `--skip-easyeffects`. \n\nFor the script entries, I'll add `easyeffects_setup.sh` with its comment, making sure to keep the ASCII tree format correct. I’ll also create a new section for EasyEffects setup, placing it between \"Apps Setup\" and \"Packet Tracer Setup\" for clarity while adjusting the line numbers accordingly.\n\n**Patching README for new features**\n\nI'm planning to make several updates to the README. First, I’ll insert the section for EasyEffects setup, ensuring it fits smoothly with existing content. I'll add lines for installing EasyEffects audio presets in the Individual Script Usage section, placing it logically after the Vietnamese input installation.\n\nNext, I’ll patch the features list to include a bullet for Audio Effects, detailing EasyEffects presets and settings. I'll also update the options section and project structure to reflect these new changes. Additionally, I think it’s worth noting the gRPC endpoint for Qdrant, even if it wasn't explicitly requested. It seems like a useful detail!\n\n**Updating Qdrant section and TODOs**\n\nI'm planning updates for the Qdrant section in the README. I’ll modify the bullet to include the gRPC endpoint, stating that it’s available at both localhost:6333 (REST) and localhost:6334 (gRPC). This addition makes the information more comprehensive. I also need to document the EasyEffects support and ensure that the audit findings are noted. \n\nBefore doing apply_diff for the changes, I’ll update the TODO list to reflect completed and ongoing tasks. I’ll make sure to follow the one-tool-per-message guideline.","partial":false},{"ts":1764572312111,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"","partial":false},{"ts":1764572312228,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"21bdacf8bf82b47417d4dc00be4f9866fb3d97bf","checkpoint":{"from":"982de7869ffecca19a5e8a6d5482da83aff02a26","to":"21bdacf8bf82b47417d4dc00be4f9866fb3d97bf","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764572312231,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"updateTodoList\",\"todos\":[{\"id\":\"f4a394751e0826d3ce5de94b61c66b17\",\"content\":\"Analyze README.md and scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh to understand current EasyEffects behavior and existing docs\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"6889b241bafa059e2363977f98a42385\",\"content\":\"Design and write a new EasyEffects section for README.md, including presets and --skip-easyeffects flag\",\"status\":\"in_progress\"},{\"id\":\"e953cc9342324c3f8e2508bbd69a446c\",\"content\":\"Audit README.md against setup.sh and all scripts/ to find undocumented scripts, features, or flags\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"279e054f96c7f7a0c43817750b9942b8\",\"content\":\"Update README.md to document any additional missing features/flags discovered in the audit\",\"status\":\"pending\"},{\"id\":\"01d7bffd1992d1f7be928b417cfa4859\",\"content\":\"Run basic verification (e.g., bash -n) and then git add . and git commit with a docs(readme) message\",\"status\":\"pending\"},{\"id\":\"60111c8f9b596ddf2753aa9dd208ee66\",\"content\":\"Summarize changes and signal completion via attempt_completion\",\"status\":\"pending\"}]}","partial":false,"isProtected":false},{"ts":1764572312440,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":50365,\"tokensOut\":6392,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":44672,\"cost\":0.07662025,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764572333266,"type":"say","say":"reasoning","text":"I'm thinking about a tool call for apply_diff with XML CDATA, and I realize we don’t need any markup inside that. I’ll plan to change multiple parts, specifically focusing on bullet points 11 to 18 in the features list. It's interesting to make these adjustments, but I want to ensure I get each part right. I need to pay attention to the specifics to make the updates effective!I’m reviewing my current setup features, particularly the Power Tools section, which includes various tools. I need to add ripgrep and fd-find there. I also want to create a new bullet point for EasyEffects, but I'm unsure about where to place it—maybe after Additional Apps or even before? It’s a little tricky to decide, but I want to ensure everything is organized and easy to understand. I’ll map this out carefully!I’m considering where to place EasyEffects in my features list. I think I should put it near audio—maybe after Additional Apps or Qdrant? Since it’s focused on audio integration, it feels right to slot it before Additional Apps or near Tools. The audio-specific section could look like this: \n\n- **Audio Processing**: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets (for my G560 speakers and G435 headset).\n\nI also plan to update usage options and the project structure to accommodate these changes, ensuring everything flows smoothly.In the README, the current installation order is Core, Terminal Enhancement, VS Code, Qdrant, Godot, Apps, Packet Tracer, and Vietnamese Input. It looks like EasyEffects doesn't have a spot. I think the best place for it would be after Packet Tracer and before Vietnamese Input, or perhaps between Apps and Packet Tracer? This would align with how the orchestrator runs the tasks. I’ll add a new section summarizing the script right after the Packet Tracer section. It sounds good!I'm thinking about how to set up the EasyEffects audio section in the README. I want it to install EasyEffects and restore presets from a specific config path. I need to ensure paths are clickable, but I'm not sure if I need to transform all inline code references into clickable links—the instructions say they should be, but since we’re editing the README content, maybe it’s flexible.\n\nThen I'll add the command for running EasyEffects setup into the usage options. This will shift existing line numbers, so I’ll need to calculate those carefully while crafting the new diff with multiple blocks based on my edits!I’m reviewing the usages and installations for the README. I need to align the options related to power tools with the features list, updating it to include ripgrep and fd-find. I also plan to add a new line to skip EasyEffects installation. For spacing, I’ll ensure everything maintains the proper alignment with two spaces between flags and descriptions.\n\nNext, I'll insert the EasyEffects setup under the Project Structure section and create a new block for it in the installations area, maintaining good spacing and format throughout. This all seems pretty straightforward!I’m reviewing how to update the Individual Script Usage section to include the EasyEffects setup. I see that I should logically group it after the Packet Tracer uninstall option, placing the EasyEffects line right before the Vietnamese input installation. \n\nI’ll adjust the snippet accordingly to reflect these updates. Additionally, I need to make sure the features bullet points are updated to include the new items like ripgrep and fd.

First, the setup flags in setup.sh include several options like --minimal and --help, which are covered. The SKIP_VIETNAMESE variable is correctly documented.\n\nFor godot_setup.sh, it runs with --uninstall, and the README mentions the specific version for installation. Packettracer_setup.sh also has --uninstall with a clear README.\n\nHowever, apps_setup.sh, qdrant_setup.sh, vscode_setup.sh, and enhance_terminal.sh don't have flags. The input_setup.sh lacks flags but does have documented usage, and I aligned the Power Tools listing too.\n\n**Reviewing feature updates**\n\nI updated the features list and CLI description for the `--enhance` option to include ripgrep and fd-find. I’m checking other sections like What Gets Installed, which now consistently lists those two tools. \n\nThe user asked for a full audit of the scripts, and the only mismatches noted were related to skip-easyeffects and the usage of ripgrep/fd-find. There's also a nuance with the Qdrant script, which mentions the QDRANT_STORAGE path, while the README lacks specifics about the storage directory. Should we consider that missing? It's debatable, but we noted other features already documented.\n\n**Clarifying memory-bank updates**\n\nI need to check the memory-bank architecture, which lists options from setup.sh, including `--skip-easyeffects`, and ensure our README aligns with those options. Next, I have to update the todo list: marking item 5 as complete and item 6 as in progress. \n\nWhile there's no strict requirement to update after the attempt, I think it's formal to mark item 6 as in progress before sending it. So, I’ll call update_todo_list for this message. It should work out fine!\n\n**Following Markdown rules**\n\nI need to adhere to Markdown rules regarding language constructs and filenames. All references must be clickable, like this: [`filename` or `language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line). This is tricky since we've used that format before. While I may not introduce new filenames here, it’s safer to mention README and format it as a link.\n\nAlso, I shouldn't start the message with something like \"Great.\" Instead, I’ll go straight to, \"Syntax checks and commit completed successfully…\" I’ll also mention that the bash tests succeeded, the commit is done, and I’ll call update_todo_list.\n\n**Preparing message format**\n\nI need to craft a message with two short paragraphs followed by a tool call. I must remember not to add any extra text after the tool tag, as the instructions specify that tool calls should be at the end of the message.\n\nNow, I’ll prepare the updated todo list content, which includes:\n\n- [x] Analyze...\n- [x] Design...\n- [x] Audit...\n- [x] Update README...\n- [x] Run basic verification...\n- [-] Summarize changes and signal completion via attempt_completion.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to move forward with that!","partial":false},{"ts":1764572457171,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"","partial":false},{"ts":1764572457275,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"949babed5879229371b36ac707d8b6dd6abec39a","checkpoint":{"from":"7f7d9056150fb424d46e16159a2e66db8cef829d","to":"949babed5879229371b36ac707d8b6dd6abec39a","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764572457277,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"updateTodoList\",\"todos\":[{\"id\":\"f4a394751e0826d3ce5de94b61c66b17\",\"content\":\"Analyze README.md and scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh to understand current EasyEffects behavior and existing docs\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"83fe3bbe88e6278e6831561832916124\",\"content\":\"Design and write a new EasyEffects section for README.md, including presets and --skip-easyeffects flag\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"e953cc9342324c3f8e2508bbd69a446c\",\"content\":\"Audit README.md against setup.sh and all scripts/ to find undocumented scripts, features, or flags\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"0c09172dcabd5e3d7e4bdd91acfc6d45\",\"content\":\"Update README.md to document any additional missing features/flags discovered in the audit\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"c8dc5dc1786e72c9ae2b80c5848da7b4\",\"content\":\"Run basic verification (e.g., bash -n) and then git add . and git commit with a docs(readme) message\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"59d6e22860ec50109950873eb049fd98\",\"content\":\"Summarize changes and signal completion via attempt_completion\",\"status\":\"in_progress\"}]}","partial":false,"isProtected":false},{"ts":1764572457464,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":54930,\"tokensOut\":2773,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":54272,\"cost\":0.0353365,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764572467272,"type":"say","say":"reasoning","text":"**Clarifying filename references**\n\nSo, for simple filenames, we might be able to omit the `:line`, but the instructions say to reference filenames as clickable links with or without the line number.

Here is a concise summary of what was done and how README now reflects the EasyEffects feature and all relevant flags.\n\n## 1. Analysis of Existing Docs and Scripts\n\nI reviewed:\n\n- The main documentation in [`README.md`](README.md).\n- The EasyEffects integration script [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh).\n- The orchestrator and related scripts:\n  - [`setup.sh`](setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/core_setup.sh`](scripts/core_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh)\n  - [`scripts/vscode_setup.sh`](scripts/vscode_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/qdrant_setup.sh`](scripts/qdrant_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/godot_setup.sh`](scripts/godot_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/apps_setup.sh`](scripts/apps_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/packettracer_setup.sh`](scripts/packettracer_setup.sh)\n  - [`scripts/input_setup.sh`](scripts/input_setup.sh)\n\nFindings specific to EasyEffects:\n\n- `setup.sh` supports a `--skip-easyeffects` flag and, by default, runs [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) as part of the full install.\n- [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) does the following:\n  - Installs `easyeffects` via `dnf_install`.\n  - Restores presets and config from `assets/.config/easyeffects` into `~/.config/easyeffects`.\n  - If Flatpak EasyEffects exists at `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects`, it also copies presets into that per-app config path.\n  - Presets include device-specific profiles (G560, G435) and **autoload rules** so presets switch automatically when devices change.\n  - Prints guidance on launching EasyEffects and selecting/using presets.\n- README previously:\n  - Did not mention EasyEffects at all.\n  - Did not document `--skip-easyeffects`.\n  - Did not list `easyeffects_setup.sh` in the scripts tree.\n  - Had no “What Gets Installed” subsection for EasyEffects.\n  - Had no example for running `easyeffects_setup.sh` directly.\n\n## 2. README Updates for EasyEffects\n\nI updated [`README.md`](README.md) in several places to surface the EasyEffects feature clearly.\n\n### 2.1 Features List\n\nIn the **Features** section, I:\n\n- Left existing items intact.\n- Added EasyEffects as an explicit feature.\n- Also made the power tools list more accurate by including `ripgrep` and `fd-find` (which are actually installed by [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh)).\n\nBefore (power tools & no audio):\n\n- `**Power Tools**: zoxide, eza, bat, fzf, lazygit, yazi`\n- No audio entry.\n\nAfter:\n\n- `**Power Tools**: zoxide, eza, bat, fzf, ripgrep, fd-find, lazygit, yazi`\n- Added:\n  - `**Audio Processing**: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets and autoload rules`\n\nThis makes it clear that the environment includes a tuned audio processing pipeline, not just visual and terminal tooling.\n\n### 2.2 Usage / Options: `--skip-easyeffects`\n\nIn the **Usage** block that documents `./setup.sh [OPTIONS]`, I:\n\n- Kept all existing flags.\n- Updated the `--enhance` description to include the full power-tool list (`ripgrep`, `fd-find`) to match the implementation in [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh).\n- Added the missing EasyEffects flag:\n\n```text\n--skip-easyeffects  Skip EasyEffects audio setup\n```\n\nSo the options list now matches `show_help()` in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) with respect to EasyEffects.\n\n### 2.3 Project Structure: Scripts List\n\nIn the **Project Structure** section, under `scripts/`, I:\n\n- Inserted the missing EasyEffects script:\n\n```text\n├── easyeffects_setup.sh    # EasyEffects audio presets and configuration\n```\n\nThe list now mirrors the actual contents of `scripts/` as confirmed by the directory listing.\n\n### 2.4 “What Gets Installed”: EasyEffects Section\n\nUnder **What Gets Installed**, I added a new subsection:\n\n```markdown\n### EasyEffects Audio Setup (`easyeffects_setup.sh`)\n- Installs EasyEffects via DNF\n- Restores audio presets and configuration from `assets/.config/easyeffects` into `~/.config/easyeffects`\n- If Flatpak EasyEffects is installed, also syncs presets to `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects`\n- Includes pre-tuned output presets (e.g., G560 speakers, G435 headset)\n- Includes autoload rules so presets switch automatically based on the active audio device\n```\n\nThis describes:\n\n- **What** the script installs.\n- **Where** presets come from and are placed.\n- **How** the Flatpak integration behaves.\n- **Which devices** have custom tuning (G560, G435).\n- **Why** it matters (automatic preset switching via autoload rules).\n\n### 2.5 Individual Script Usage: EasyEffects\n\nIn the **Individual Script Usage** section, I added a direct invocation example for EasyEffects:\n\n```bash\n# Run only EasyEffects audio setup\nbash scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern already used for other feature scripts and allows users to re-apply or re-sync audio presets independently of the full `setup.sh` flow.\n\n## 3. Audit of README Against All Scripts\n\nI cross-checked README against:\n\n- Flags and flow in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh).\n- Behavior of all setup scripts under `scripts/`.\n\nFindings and resolutions:\n\n1. **EasyEffects flag and script**\n   - `--skip-easyeffects` existed in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) but was not documented.\n   - [`scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh`](scripts/easyeffects_setup.sh) existed but was not listed in the project structure, had no “What Gets Installed” entry, and no individual usage example.\n   - These are now fully documented as described above.\n\n2. **Power tools list for `--enhance`**\n   - [`scripts/enhance_terminal.sh`](scripts/enhance_terminal.sh) installs:\n     - `zoxide`, `eza`, `bat`, `fzf`, `ripgrep`, `fd-find` via DNF.\n     - `lazygit` via COPR.\n     - `yazi` via a prebuilt binary.\n   - README’s Features and Usage texts previously omitted `ripgrep` and `fd-find`.\n   - I updated:\n     - The **Features** bullet to include `ripgrep`, `fd-find`.\n     - The `--enhance` description in the **Usage** section to match the actual set of tools.\n\n3. **Other scripts and behaviors**\n   - `--minimal`, `--skip-vscode`, `--skip-qdrant`, `--skip-godot`, `--skip-apps`, `--skip-packettracer`, `--vietnamese`, and `--enhance` were already documented in README and match the argument parsing in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh).\n   - README already documented:\n     - `GODOT_VERSION` environment variable and `--uninstall` for Godot.\n     - `--uninstall` for Packet Tracer.\n     - Qdrant behavior (Podman service, ports).\n     - VS Code behavior (settings, extensions, Kilo Code global storage).\n     - Apps, Packet Tracer, and Vietnamese input setup.\n   - No additional flags or modes beyond EasyEffects were missing from the README.\n\nNet result: README is now aligned with all current scripts and flags.\n\n## 4. Verification and Commit\n\nTo ensure a clean change, I:\n\n1. Ran a Bash syntax check on the orchestrator and all scripts:\n\n   ```bash\n   bash -n setup.sh scripts/*.sh\n   ```\n\n   This completed successfully (exit code 0).\n\n2. Staged and committed the documentation update:\n\n   ```bash\n   git add README.md\n   git commit -m \"docs(readme): document EasyEffects audio setup\"\n   ```\n\n   The commit succeeded and includes only the README changes (15 insertions, 2 deletions).\n\n## 5. Summary of User-Visible Changes\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, the documentation now:\n\n- Clearly advertises **EasyEffects** in the Features list as “Audio Processing: EasyEffects with pre-tuned presets and autoload rules”.\n- Documents the **`--skip-easyeffects`** flag alongside other CLI options.\n- Shows **`easyeffects_setup.sh`** in the scripts tree with a short description.\n- Provides a dedicated **“EasyEffects Audio Setup”** section under “What Gets Installed” explaining:\n  - Installation.\n  - Preset locations.\n  - Flatpak integration.\n  - Device-specific tuning (G560, G435).\n  - Automatic preset switching.\n- Includes an **individual script usage example** for running just the EasyEffects setup.\n- Aligns the documented power tools for `--enhance` with the actual tools installed (`ripgrep`, `fd-find` included).\n\nThe README is now up-to-date with the EasyEffects feature and remains consistent with all existing scripts and flags in this repository.","partial":false},{"ts":1764572486414,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"finishTask\"}","isProtected":false}]
