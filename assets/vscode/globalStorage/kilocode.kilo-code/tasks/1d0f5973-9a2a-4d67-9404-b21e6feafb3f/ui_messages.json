Security stance\n\n- Your private SSH keys never touch git or any remote service.\n- No SSH-related automation is added to this terminal-setup repository.\n- All sensitive material stays on:\n  - Your current machine\n  - A physical USB device you control\n\nThis is a very conservative and safe choice, especially if you are careful with the USB device.\n\n2. What to back up onto USB\n\nWhen you say “copy ssh vào usb”, you are typically copying the entire SSH directory from your home folder:\n\n- The directory to back up:\n  - `~/.ssh` (all contents)\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Private keys (secrets)\n- Public keys\n- SSH config\n- known_hosts, authorized_keys, etc.\n\nBecause the USB is your own physical device, copying the entire directory is fine as long as you treat the USB like something that contains secrets (similar sensitivity to a password manager export).\n\n3. Safe manual workflow (source machine → USB)\n\nConceptually:\n\n1. Plug in the USB drive and mount it (your file manager or desktop environment usually does this automatically).\n2. Copy the entire SSH directory onto the USB:\n   - For example, in a file manager:\n     - Show hidden files\n     - Copy `~/.ssh` to a folder on the USB, maybe named with the date and host, like `ssh-backup-<hostname>-<date>`.\n3. Eject/unmount the USB safely.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\n- Treat this USB as sensitive:\n  - Do not lend it or leave it unattended.\n  - If you later discard the USB, securely wipe it first.\n- If you are extra cautious, consider:\n  - Storing the backup **inside an encrypted volume** on the USB (e.g. LUKS, VeraCrypt, or an encrypted archive using GPG).\n  - Keeping **two** copies (e.g. two separate USB keys) in different safe locations, to avoid single-device failure.\n\n4. Restoring on a new machine (USB → target machine)\n\nWhen you want to restore:\n\n1. Plug in the USB on the new machine and mount it.\n2. Copy the backed-up `.ssh` directory from the USB to your home directory.\n3. Check permissions:\n   - The `.ssh` directory should be owned by your user, with permissions disallowing others (typically 700 on the directory and 600 on private key files).\n4. Test SSH connections to confirm everything works.\n\n5. Impact on this repository\n\nSince you chose the USB-based approach:\n\n- No new files, scripts, or logic related to SSH backup are required in this repo.\n- Nothing under `.ssh` will be added to `assets/` or version control.\n- Code mode does **not** need to implement anything for SSH backup.\n\nThis completes the task from the repository’s point of view: SSH backup is intentionally kept **out of scope** for this project and handled manually via a secure USB workflow you control."},{"ts":1764570283338,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":26089,\"tokensOut\":258,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":0,\"cost\":0.055274000000000004,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764570294172,"type":"say","say":"text","text":""},{"ts":1764570294257,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"ae0f4e1504886c36a12d34ca91810d55c2ae7516","checkpoint":{"from":"da9d1e729ecca8970ca8a9a99d094cc150726afb","to":"ae0f4e1504886c36a12d34ca91810d55c2ae7516","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764570294259,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"updateTodoList\",\"todos\":[{\"id\":\"6a9f4752e32f80504cc767b8e434bcc7\",\"content\":\"Analyze security implications and design a safe backup strategy for .ssh\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"9cb543ee9ee7bdb08b7c386794d98896\",\"content\":\"Implement the chosen backup solution (Skipped: Manual USB backup strategy chosen)\",\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"id\":\"011afd32598d128399134c23a992fa34\",\"content\":\"Verify the backup mechanism (Skipped)\",\"status\":\"completed\"}]}","partial":false,"isProtected":false},{"ts":1764570295237,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":26756,\"tokensOut\":212,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":24301,\"cost\":0.0074540000000000006,\"usageMissing\":false}"},{"ts":1764570301908,"type":"say","say":"text","text":""},{"ts":1764570301988,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"9baf20d145d62d46c78b5f94b6c6fd3043284ca0","checkpoint":{"from":"ae0f4e1504886c36a12d34ca91810d55c2ae7516","to":"9baf20d145d62d46c78b5f94b6c6fd3043284ca0","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1764570301989,"type":"say","say":"completion_result","text":"The request to \"backup .ssh\" has been analyzed.\n\n**Outcome:**\nFor security reasons, we will **not** implement an automated script to backup SSH keys into this repository or the `assets/` folder.
